# MAFEX Batman (Hush) Black Version Review

Medicom Toy's MAFEX line continues to solidify itself as a premium collector brand, and their latest Batman release—the "Hush" Black Version—exemplifies why these figures are in such high demand.

## Packaging & Presentation

The figure comes in MAFEX's standard window box packaging with striking artwork from the "Batman: Hush" comic run. Inside, Batman and his accessories are securely held in a plastic tray. The presentation is clean and collector-friendly, allowing for easy storage and repackaging.

## Figure Details & Build Quality

Standing at approximately 6.3 inches (16cm), this Batman figure captures the Jim Lee design perfectly. The all-black costume variant offers a striking alternative to the blue and gray version released previously. The cape is made of a flexible material that drapes naturally and holds poses well.

Construction quality is solid, with tight joints and durable plastic. Unlike some earlier MAFEX releases, I found no loose joints or quality control issues with this sample.

## Articulation

The figure features over 30 points of articulation, including:
- Double-jointed neck
- Butterfly shoulder joints
- Double-jointed elbows and knees
- Torso ab crunch and waist swivel
- Drop-down hip joints for wider stances
- Articulated cape connection points

The range of motion is excellent, allowing Batman to achieve dynamic fighting poses, crouching positions, and even the iconic "perched on a gargoyle" look.

## Accessories

This release comes with an impressive array of accessories:
- Three interchangeable head sculpts (standard, gritted teeth, and shouting)
- Multiple interchangeable hands (fists, open hands, gripping hands)
- Batarang
- Grapnel gun
- Fabric cape with wire in the edges for posing
- Figure stand with articulated arm

Everything you need to create nearly any Batman scene is included, and the accessories are all well-made and scaled appropriately.

## Final Verdict

The MAFEX Batman (Hush) Black Version earns a strong 9/10 rating. It's a near-perfect figure with only minor issues that don't detract from the overall quality. The improved build quality compared to earlier MAFEX releases is particularly noteworthy.

At around $90-100 USD, it's positioned at the higher end of 6-inch scale figures, but the quality, articulation, and accessories justify the price for serious collectors. If you're a Batman fan looking for the definitive action figure representation of Jim Lee's iconic design, this release is highly recommended.
