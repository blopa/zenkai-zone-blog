# SH Figuarts Dragon Ball Super Son Goku Ultra Instinct Review

Few characters in the Dragon Ball universe have the same hype factor as Goku in his Ultra Instinct form. Bandai’s SH Figuarts line brings us a collectible that tries to capture that energy — and mostly succeeds.

## First Impressions

Out of the box, this figure looks impressive. The sculpt is sharp, with defined musculature and battle-worn clothing details that add depth. The silver hair paint app shines just right under direct lighting.

The packaging is sleek and minimal, which is consistent with other recent SH Figuarts releases. Included accessories are generous: multiple faceplates, hands, and a Kamehameha effect part.

## Articulation & Posing

Posability is where SH Figuarts always shines, and this figure is no exception. You can get Goku into dynamic fighting stances, wide crouches, and even recreate scenes from the Tournament of Power with ease.

The joint system is smooth, although some users may find the torso crunch a little limited. Still, the shoulder and hip mobility more than make up for it.

## Paint & Detailing

Bandai went with a more matte finish for the body, which complements the metallic hair nicely. The battle damage on the gi is painted subtly but effectively. Facial expressions are printed with precision — no derpy eyes here.

## Final Thoughts

This figure is a must-have for any Dragon Ball collector, especially fans of Goku’s Ultra Instinct form. At its price point, it delivers on sculpt, accessories, and articulation.

If you’re looking to add a powerful and poseable version of Goku to your shelf, this one punches well above its weight.
