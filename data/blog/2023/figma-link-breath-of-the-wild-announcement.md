# Good Smile Announces New Figma Link from Breath of the Wild

Good Smile Company has just revealed their newest addition to the popular Figma line - Link from *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*. This highly-anticipated figure brings the beloved hero to life with incredible detail and articulation.

## Product Details

The new Figma Link stands approximately 14cm tall and features the character in his iconic blue "Champion's Tunic" outfit from the game. As expected from the Figma line, the figure includes multiple accessories:

- Master Sword and scabbard
- Hylian Shield
- Bow and arrow set
- Several interchangeable face plates
- Multiple hands for different poses

The figure recreates Link's look with impressive attention to detail, from the weathered appearance of his clothing to the subtle textures of his equipment.

## Articulation and Features

Like all Figma figures, this Link includes the smooth joints and wide range of articulation that collectors have come to expect from the line. Special attention has been paid to the shoulder and hip joints to allow for dynamic action poses.

The figure also includes a display stand for aerial poses, and the weapons can be stored on the figure just as they appear in the game.

## Release Information

Pre-orders for the Figma Link are set to begin next month, with the figure expected to ship in early 2024. The retail price is set at approximately $85 USD, which is standard for Figma releases of this complexity.

Collectors interested in securing this figure are advised to pre-order early, as previous Legend of Zelda Figma releases have sold out quickly and commanded high prices on the secondary market.

## Initial Impressions

From the promotional images, this appears to be one of Good Smile's strongest Nintendo character releases to date. The proportions look accurate to the game model, and the face sculpt captures Link's determined expression perfectly.

Stay tuned for a full review once the figure is released!
